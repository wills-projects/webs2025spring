      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! My name is William Lee. I'm currently a junior at the
        University of Pittsburgh studying in computer and information science.
        I'm an aspiring software developer, focusing on full stack development
        and IT. This summer I'm excited to join Howmet Aerospace as their
        finance applications development intern! I hope you'll join me along the
        way for this awesome journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, practicing piano, and
        going out with friends! I've recently enjoyed playing the game VALORANT
        and performing on stage with the Pitt Jazz Ensemble. I hope you enjoy
        looking around my portfolio, while you're here check out my
